## CDP SDK

This module contains the Python CDP SDK, which is a library that provides a client for interacting with the [Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/). It includes a CDP Client for interacting with EVM and Solana APIs to create accounts and send transactions, as well as authentication tools for interacting directly with the CDP APIs.

## Documentation

CDP SDK has [auto-generated docs for the Python SDK](https://coinbase.github.io/cdp-sdk/python).

Further documentation is also available on the CDP docs website:

- [Wallet API v2](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-api-v2/docs/welcome)
- [API Reference](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-v2/docs/welcome)

## Installation

```bash
pip install cdp-sdk
```

## API Keys

To start, [create a CDP API Key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/access/api). Save the `API Key ID` and `API Key Secret` for use in the SDK. You will also need to create a wallet secret in the Portal to sign transactions.

## Usage

### Initialization

#### Load client config from shell

One option is to export your CDP API Key and Wallet Secret as environment variables:

```bash
export CDP_API_KEY_ID="YOUR_API_KEY_ID"
export CDP_API_KEY_SECRET="YOUR_API_KEY_SECRET"
export CDP_WALLET_SECRET="YOUR_WALLET_SECRET"
```

Then, initialize the client:

```python
from cdp import CdpClient
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        pass

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Load client config from `.env` file

Another option is to save your CDP API Key and Wallet Secret in a `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
echo "CDP_API_KEY_ID=YOUR_API_KEY_ID" >> .env
echo "CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=YOUR_API_KEY_SECRET" >> .env
echo "CDP_WALLET_SECRET=YOUR_WALLET_SECRET" >> .env
```

Then, load the client config from the `.env` file:

```python
from cdp import CdpClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        pass

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Pass the API Key and Wallet Secret to the client

Another option is to directly pass the API Key and Wallet Secret to the client:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient(
        api_key_id="YOUR_API_KEY_ID",
        api_key_secret="YOUR_API_KEY_SECRET",
        wallet_secret="YOUR_WALLET_SECRET",
    ) as cdp:
        pass

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Creating EVM or Solana accounts

#### Create an EVM account as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        account = await cdp.evm.create_account()

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Create a Solana account as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        account = await cdp.solana.create_account()

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Get or create an EVM account as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        account = await cdp.evm.get_or_create_account()

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Get or create a Solana account as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        account = await cdp.solana.get_or_create_account()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Testnet faucet

You can use the faucet function to request testnet ETH or SOL from the CDP.

#### Request testnet ETH as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        await cdp.evm.request_faucet(
            address=evm_account.address, network="base-sepolia", token="eth"
        )

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Request testnet SOL as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        await cdp.solana.request_faucet(
            address=address, token="sol"
        )

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Sending transactions

#### EVM

You can use CDP SDK to send transactions on EVM networks. By default, Coinbase will manage the nonce and gas for you.

```python
import asyncio

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from web3 import Web3

from cdp import CdpClient
from cdp.evm_transaction_types import TransactionRequestEIP1559

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://sepolia.base.org"))


async def main():
    load_dotenv()

    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        evm_account = await cdp.evm.create_account()

        faucet_hash = await cdp.evm.request_faucet(
            address=evm_account.address, network="base-sepolia", token="eth"
        )

        w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(faucet_hash)

        zero_address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

        amount_to_send = w3.to_wei(0.000001, "ether")

        tx_hash = await cdp.evm.send_transaction(
            address=evm_account.address,
            transaction=TransactionRequestEIP1559(
                to=zero_address,
                value=amount_to_send,
            ),
            network="base-sepolia",
        )

        print(f"Transaction sent! Hash: {tx_hash}")

        print("Waiting for transaction confirmation...")
        tx_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
        print(f"Transaction confirmed in block {tx_receipt.blockNumber}")
        print(f"Transaction status: {'Success' if tx_receipt.status == 1 else 'Failed'}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

If you'd like to manage the nonce and gas yourself, you can do so as follows:

```python
import asyncio

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from web3 import Web3

from cdp import CdpClient
from cdp.evm_transaction_types import TransactionRequestEIP1559

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://sepolia.base.org"))


async def main():
    load_dotenv()

    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        evm_account = await cdp.evm.create_account()

        faucet_hash = await cdp.evm.request_faucet(
            address=evm_account.address, network="base-sepolia", token="eth"
        )

        w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(faucet_hash)

        zero_address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

        amount_to_send = w3.to_wei(0.000001, "ether")

        nonce = w3.eth.get_transaction_count(evm_account.address)

        gas_estimate = w3.eth.estimate_gas(
            {"to": zero_address, "from": evm_account.address, "value": amount_to_send}
        )

        max_priority_fee = w3.eth.max_priority_fee
        max_fee = w3.eth.gas_price + max_priority_fee

        tx_hash = await cdp.evm.send_transaction(
            address=evm_account.address,
            transaction=TransactionRequestEIP1559(
                to=zero_address,
                value=amount_to_send,
                gas=gas_estimate,
                maxFeePerGas=max_fee,
                maxPriorityFeePerGas=max_priority_fee,
                nonce=nonce,
            ),
            network="base-sepolia",
        )

        print(f"Transaction sent! Hash: {tx_hash}")

        print("Waiting for transaction confirmation...")
        tx_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
        print(f"Transaction confirmed in block {tx_receipt.blockNumber}")
        print(f"Transaction status: {'Success' if tx_receipt.status == 1 else 'Failed'}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

You can also use `DynamicFeeTransaction` from `eth-account`:

```python
import asyncio

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from web3 import Web3

from cdp import CdpClient
from eth_account.typed_transactions import DynamicFeeTransaction

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://sepolia.base.org"))


async def main():
    load_dotenv()

    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        evm_account = await cdp.evm.create_account()

        faucet_hash = await cdp.evm.request_faucet(
            address=evm_account.address, network="base-sepolia", token="eth"
        )

        w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(faucet_hash)

        zero_address = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

        amount_to_send = w3.to_wei(0.000001, "ether")

        nonce = w3.eth.get_transaction_count(evm_account.address)

        gas_estimate = w3.eth.estimate_gas(
            {"to": zero_address, "from": evm_account.address, "value": amount_to_send}
        )

        max_priority_fee = w3.eth.max_priority_fee
        max_fee = w3.eth.gas_price + max_priority_fee

        tx_hash = await cdp.evm.send_transaction(
            address=evm_account.address,
            transaction=DynamicFeeTransaction.from_dict(
                {
                "to": zero_address,
                "value": amount_to_send,
                "chainId": 84532,
                "gas": gas_estimate,
                "maxFeePerGas": max_fee,
                "maxPriorityFeePerGas": max_priority_fee,
                "nonce": nonce,
                "type": "0x2",
                }
            ),
            network="base-sepolia",
        )

        print(f"Transaction sent! Hash: {tx_hash}")

        print("Waiting for transaction confirmation...")
        tx_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
        print(f"Transaction confirmed in block {tx_receipt.blockNumber}")
        print(f"Transaction status: {'Success' if tx_receipt.status == 1 else 'Failed'}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Transferring tokens

For complete examples, check out [account.transfer.py](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/blob/main/examples/python/evm/account.transfer.py) and [smartAccount.transfer.py](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/blob/main/examples/python/evm/smartAccount.transfer.py).

You can transfer tokens between accounts using the `transfer` function:

```python
sender = await cdp.evm.create_account(name="Sender")

transfer_result = await sender.transfer(
    TransferOptions(
        to="0x9F663335Cd6Ad02a37B633602E98866CF944124d",
        amount="0.01",
        token="usdc",
        network="base-sepolia",
    )
)
```

Smart Accounts also have a `transfer` function:

```python
sender = await cdp.evm.create_smart_account(
    owner=privateKeyToAccount(generatePrivateKey()),
);
print("Created smart account", sender);

transfer_result = await sender.transfer(
    TransferOptions(
        to="0x9F663335Cd6Ad02a37B633602E98866CF944124d",
        amount="0.01",
        token="usdc",
        network="base-sepolia",
    )
)
```

If you pass a decimal amount in a string, the SDK will parse it into a bigint based on the token's decimals. You can also pass a bigint directly:

```python
transfer_result = await sender.transfer(
    TransferOptions(
        to="0x9F663335Cd6Ad02a37B633602E98866CF944124d",
        amount=10000n, # equivalent to 0.01 usdc
        token="usdc",
        network="base-sepolia",
    )
)
```

You can pass `usdc` or `eth` as the token to transfer, or you can pass a contract address directly:

```python
transfer_result = await sender.transfer(
    TransferOptions(
        to="0x9F663335Cd6Ad02a37B633602E98866CF944124d",
        amount="0.000001",
        token="0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006", # WETH on Base Sepolia
        network="base-sepolia",
    )
)
```

You can also pass another account as the `to` parameter:

```python
sender = await cdp.evm.create_account(name="Sender")
receiver = await cdp.evm.create_account(name="Receiver")

transfer_result = await sender.transfer(
    TransferOptions(
        to=receiver,
        amount="0.01",
        token="usdc",
        network="base-sepolia",
    )
)
```

#### Solana

For Solana, we recommend using the `solana` library to send transactions. See the [examples](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/tree/main/examples/python/solana/send_transaction.py).

### EVM Smart Accounts

For EVM, we support Smart Accounts which are account-abstraction (ERC-4337) accounts. Currently there is only support for Base Sepolia and Base Mainnet for Smart Accounts.

#### Create an EVM account and a smart account as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        evm_account = await cdp.evm.create_account()
        smart_account = await cdp.evm.create_smart_account(
            owner=evm_account
        )

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Sending User Operations

```python
import asyncio
from cdp.evm_call_types import EncodedCall
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
        user_operation = await cdp.evm.send_user_operation(
            smart_account=smart_account,
            network="base-sepolia",
            calls=[
                EncodedCall(
                    to="0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
                    value=0,
                    data="0x"
                )
            ]
        )

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### In Base Sepolia, all user operations are gasless by default. If you'd like to specify a different paymaster, you can do so as follows:

```python
import asyncio
from cdp.evm_call_types import EncodedCall
from cdp import CdpClient

async def main():
    async with CdpClient() as cdp:
    user_operation = await cdp.evm.send_user_operation(
        smart_account=smart_account,
        network="base-sepolia",
        calls=[],
            paymaster_url="https://some-paymaster-url.com"
        )

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Authentication tools

This SDK also contains simple tools for authenticating REST API requests to the [Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/). See the [Auth README](cdp/auth/README.md) for more details.

## Error Reporting

This SDK contains error reporting functionality that sends error events to the CDP. If you would like to disable this behavior, you can set the `DISABLE_CDP_ERROR_REPORTING` environment variable to `true`.

```bash
DISABLE_CDP_ERROR_REPORTING=true
```
